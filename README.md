## Project Proposal: Structured Career Development for a Competitive Tech Job Market

**Vision Statement:**  
The goal of this project is to help me improve my professional skills by working on job application materials, applying to grad school, building up technical skills, and preparing for interviews. Breaking my transition into the workforce or graduate school into smaller, manageable steps allows me to stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This course provides a great opportunity for professional growth because of its structured feedback and accountability, helping me stay on track. The project gives me a solid plan for moving from being a full-time student into a professional career by focusing on key milestones like improving my resume, practicing for interviews, and enhancing my technical abilities. Sticking to this plan will help me improve my job prospects and develop the skills I need to succeed in the workforce. The structured grading and public feedback also push me to stay engaged and keep making progress.

**Motivation:**  
This professional development course keeps me accountable and provides structure to my job search. I paused working to focus on a post-baccalaureate degree, so I need a clear plan for returning to the workforce. The current job market is extremely competitive, and I want to ensure I stand out as a strong candidate. More importantly, I want to land a job that I enjoy, and the only way to do that is by putting in effort to become the best candidate I can be. By setting milestones and tracking my progress, I can overcome my usual "paralysis by analysis" and take meaningful steps toward securing a job or internship. My goals of applying to graduate school both serve to satisfy my continued interest and curiosity in computer science while also making me eligible for graduate-level internships. The notoriety of Georgia Tech can also be highly advantageous as I apply for jobs or if recruiters land on my social pages. The work I put into this project will not only help me now but will also continue to benefit my career in the long run.

**Specific and Measurable Goals:**

- **Letters of Recommendation:** Request and obtain letters from professors for graduate school applications.
- **Resume Creation and Refinement:** Develop a polished resume with feedback from others.
- **LinkedIn Optimization:** Update and refine my LinkedIn profile to align with target job roles.
- **Cover Letter Development:** Draft a strong cover letter template that can be customized for different job applications.
- **Graduate School Application:** Complete and submit an application to Georgia Tech’s Online CS Master’s program.
- **GitHub and Portfolio Enhancement:** Improve my GitHub profile, make select projects public, and build a professional personal website.
- **Job and Internship Applications:** Apply strategically to preferred positions while also submitting bulk/mass applications to increase opportunities.
- **Interview Preparation:** Research and practice common technical (LeetCode) and behavioral interview questions.
- **Technical Skill Development:** Build proficiency in Git and Vim to improve workflow efficiency and demonstrate technical competency to employers.

**Challenges and Risks:**

- **Psychological Barriers:** Imposter syndrome, anxiety, and stress could slow progress.
- **Time Constraints:** Balancing coursework, job applications, and potential interviews may be challenging.
- **Technical Learning Curve:** Mastering Vim and Git takes time, and reaching a useful level of proficiency may require significant effort.
- **External Factors:** Recommendation letters, job application responses, and interview scheduling are outside of my control and require flexibility.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Regular Office Hour Participation:** Engaging with peers and instructors to stay motivated and recieve guidance when needed.
- **Breaking Down Tasks:** Splitting bigger goals into smaller steps to make progress feel more manageable.
- **Dedicated Work Sessions:** Setting aside specific times to work on job applications, technical prep, and other project tasks.
- **Managing Stress:** Taking breaks, exercising, and reaching out for support when needed.
- **Practical Technical Learning:** Focusing on the most useful features of Vim and Git rather than trying to master everything at once.
- **Staying Flexible:** Adjusting plans based on external factors like job market changes or unexpected opportunities.

**Project Assessment Criteria:**

- **Resume:** Completed and refined based on feedback.
- **LinkedIn:** Updated and optimized for job searches.
- **Cover Letter:** Drafted and adapted for multiple job applications.
- **Job Applications:** At least 5 targeted applications submitted.
- **Graduate School Application:** All required components submitted on time, including recommendation letters.
- **Interview Preparation:** Practicing technical and behavioral questions to improve confidence.
- **GitHub and Portfolio:** Well-documented projects, an improved home profile page, and a professional website showcasing my resume, projects, and blog.
- **Technical Proficiency:** Demonstrated knowledge of Git and Vim.

## Weekly Status Updates

### Week 2

**What did you do last week?**

Last week, I oriented myself in all my courses, posted all my Piazza introductions, and started on Week 1 materials. Besides this Professional Development course, I am also taking Database Systems and Software Development Tools. The only office hours I attended were for this course, as I hadn’t gone through the week’s material yet for the other courses. Office hours were great for brainstorming ideas with other students and beginning to discuss and develop my project. I then spent the rest of the week passively thinking about my project idea while reading through the materials for making a website. My goal even before the course started was to use this course to force myself to start preparing myself for the transition from student to employee. I had stopped working to take this program full-time, so I want to use this course to increase my likelihood of finding a job or internship that I am proud to have. The idea of setting milestones and timelines will be extremely helpful in organizing this transition and force me to stop putting it off. Currently, I am in a “paralysis by analysis” state.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week I want to solidify my goals for the project. I want to create an ordered list of tasks based on importance and “due date”. I also want to split up each task into smaller pieces to avoid getting overwhelmed and focus on one thing at a time rather than being anxious about how difficult or stressful the whole task is. My current goals for my professional development during this semester are to ask for letters of recommendation, refine my resume, update my LinkedIn, update my GitHub, apply for Georgia Tech’s Online CS Masters (this opens up internship opportunities), tailor my resume and cover letters to the jobs and internships I am most excited about, blast my resume out to as many other positions as possible to practice interviews and have backups, use the rest of my time to learn a tool that would make me more valuable or attractive (like learning Vim because it’s a way to show off or impress people and isn’t easy to learn since it needs to be memorized to be useful).

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

The biggest impediments to my progress are completely mental and have to do with getting anxious, stressed, nervous, or depressed based on what happens during this semester. Asking for letters of recommendation is very stressful because of imposter syndrome, nervousness can make a person look rigid while interviewing, the anxiety of waiting to hear back from the masters or jobs can make it difficult to concentrate, and rejection can be quite depressing. All of these put together can be very overwhelming and can make it very hard to stay motivated and focused. The job market is tough right now for new hires, so staying mentally healthy and sane is going to be as much of a challenge as any technical “real” problem.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

I’ve found that going to office hours and being able to talk through ideas somehow makes the whole project feel more manageable. When it’s stuck in my head, it feels like a lot, but then when I talk it through, I realize that I can accomplish what I want to during this semester. Office hours also makes me process work better because I can ask for people’s opinions and advice, which is what I did this week when I asked for advice about putting projects on my resume. Talking about this with people who have been through the process or have been on the other side de-mystifies it and helps me make a final decision. Finally, last week I just had project ideas in my head, but something that would help is finally sitting down and writing them all out. It will allow me to move past brainstorming and figure out how to organize them.

---

### Week 3

**What did you do last week?**

Last week, I solidified my goals for what I want to accomplish this semester as part of this professional development course and got started with my first, most important goals. It took me a little over an hour just to put together the project proposal and submit it on Piazza, my website, and Moodle, and that’s not to mention the time spent thinking it through and planning/outlining. Other than that, I spent an hour drafting up an email for professors I wanted to ask for letters of recommendation. I then showed this to some peers and was instantly told that it was far too long and polite, which was quite frustrating, but I understand now. This meant I had to go back and prune out all the unimportant information before sending it out to 3 past professors. The personalization was mostly just in the introduction and stating which courses I took with them as a reminder, so that wasn’t too difficult.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week, now that this request for the letters of recommendation is out of the way, I need to go in and add these professors (provided that they accept) to my online application so that they receive instructions on how to submit. Then I plan to start filling out the information and looking at the short answer questions so that I can start thinking about how I will want to answer them. Finally, I want to finish updating my resume so that I can start sending it out for job applications. I think I will first try to send it out to some “feeler” companies just to get a sense of how I stand in relation to other candidates, ask for feedback, and possibly even get offered interviews that I can use as practice.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

One of the biggest impediments from the previous week was being overwhelmed, but now that I have everything on paper and laid out, I’m finding that I’m feeling a lot less stressed and anxious. Asking for letters of recommendation is always really difficult for me because it’s hard to ask someone to do something for you that they are not required to do, and which gives them extra work. Other than that, my biggest impediments are some of my recommendation requests getting denied or not getting replies, and a lot of constructive criticism on my resume which required me to increase the time spent modifying and revising. Fortunately, it’s worth the extra effort, but at some point, I will need to draw a line and be proud of what I have.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

The process I used last week was just treating all of my project goals as… part of a project. The reason this helps me so much is because I feel a sense of urgency and the requirement to complete these milestones within a specific timeframe. It doesn’t let me procrastinate as much which helps my overall process just flow smoother. The process will continue to work better if I get better at my time management. I still suffer from major procrastination and do things at the last moment, so getting better at sitting down and focusing would go a long way. This career searching process can take months, so this is a skill I need to develop so that I do not get lazy and demotivated. The quicker I find a job, the quicker I’ll be happy to no longer just be a student.

---

### Week 4

**What did you do last week?**

Last week’s focus was on moving forward with my main and most time sensitive professional development goals. First, I finally finished updating my resume with up to date information, which took more time than I initially anticipated because I kept revisiting and polishing the details. I also got two responses regarding my letters of recommendation. Both professors I reached out to were very supportive and agreed to write letters on my behalf, which took a huge weight off my shoulders. Each of them asked for some extra details about myself, so I also spent time replying. Beyond that, I officially started the Georgia Tech application, filling out the basic information and setting up my account so that I can get to the short answers and other application components quickly. I told my recommenders that I would submit them as recommenders by the end of the week.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week, my main objectives are to have people proofread my resume and provide constructive feedback, completely finish my Georgia Tech application, and secure all three recommenders. Regarding the resume, while it is fully updated now, it’s also far too long and I need help choosing what information to keep and what to leave out. Sometimes I feel like that’s the hardest part because there’s so much pressure on making a good first impression, and everyone’s opinion is so different. Regardless, I’m making this week a deadline so that I force myself to get it done and become comfortable with my choices (recognizing that it can change based on what position I’m applying for). I then need to finalize any short answer questions or essays required by the application, which might take some time to polish and align with the program’s expectations. Lastly, if my third recommender doesn’t respond within the next couple days and after two follow up emails, I will have to quickly secure a third, which would be my former manager.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

Right now, the biggest impediment is making sure my third recommender responds or that I find a new one and I give them enough time to write a strong letter. It’s always a little stressful because, even though professors are often willing, I can’t know if someone just happens to be on vacation or sick. Another potential impediment is running into unexpected requirements or questions for the Georgia Tech application that might take more time than I’ve planned. As always, time management is still a challenge. I recognize that this course should only take up 3-5 hours a week, but due to the fact that this is also something I HAVE to be doing for my career, I easily go over that. This is especially true when it comes to the resume. Simple formatting changes can take over an hour sometimes, and feedback regarding format can sometimes cause everything else to have to change.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

The process of dividing everything into manageable tasks is continuing to pay off. Finishing updating my resume with current information and starting the application felt a lot less daunting once I broke them down into smaller “sub-tasks” rather than taking on “updating resume” and “finishing application” all at once. For the resume, I started by throwing everything in a document, then rewording, then polishing, then formatting, and only now am I worrying about the length. This helped me avoid procrastination and allowed me to focus on one step at a time rather than trying to polish before all the info was even there. Moving forward, I want to keep improving my time management by setting more concrete deadlines for each of my application components. This way, I can hold myself accountable and make sure I’m not leaving any parts of the application or recommendation requests until the last minute.

### Week 5

**What did you do last week?**

This past week was a bit of a scramble on the recommendation letter front. After sending multiple emails and not hearing back from one professor (I'm quite upset about it because I had him for 3 courses and put in a lot of effort in them), I decided it was time to pivot and reach out to someone else. Thankfully, Professor Gabriel Johnson responded within about an hour, which was a huge relief, and took so much stress and anxiety off my shoulders. Now I have two teachers who’ve already submitted their letters through the application portal, and I’m just waiting on the last one before I can finalize that part of my grad school application. In parallel, I spent a lot of time revising and shortening my resume, where it was extremely difficult to part with information about my past job and research that I'm proud of. I had this moment where I’d think I was done, then look at it again the next day and realize there was even more to refine. Eventually, I reached a stopping point I’m comfortable with and uploaded the finalized PDF to my website (<a href="https://lukas-talaga.github.io/resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>). Beyond that, I made decent progress on my Georgia Tech application by downloading all my transcripts from past schools, uploading them with information about my academic history, and filling in most of the required fields like all the multiple choice questions about myself.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

In the coming week, my top priority is to completely finish the Georgia Tech application, short answers and all, so that I can submit it early. The applications are reviewed in order of submission, so the sooner I submit, the sooner I'll have results that can go on my resume and job applications. I also want to start tailoring my resume specifically for job applications rather than grad school. Right now, the layout is focused on my experiences with skills at the bottom; I’m thinking about highlighting my skills at the top, since that matters more for potential employers. Another important goal is to draft a general cover letter template that I can tweak for each job posting. My idea is to have a “base cover letter” that provides an overview of my background, plus a few lines about why I’m excited for a particular role or company. That way, I’m not starting from scratch with every application.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

My main challenges haven’t changed too much. There’s still some anxiety about making sure all the application details are correct before I hit “submit,” especially with the short answer responses. I tend to overthink these kinds of prompts, worrying if I’m saying too much or not enough; luckily there are extremely short word limits for each that will force me to be succinct. Another lingering concern is whether I should wait until I (hopefully) get accepted to Georgia Tech before I start applying for jobs. Part of me worries that I’ll be seen as less qualified if I don’t have the master’s listed on my resume, and had I waited, I might have gotten the job. I’m planning on asking around to see what other people think about that, but it’s definitely something that weighs on my mind whenever I look at job postings. Another thought is to add a blurb about a potential master's acceptance in my cover letter.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

I’ve noticed that I’m still falling into the trap of perfectionism, especially when it comes to my resume and my grad school application essays. I’ll fiddle with a phrase or bullet point for way longer than I should, and I know that can be counterproductive, especially since there are more important/larger things that need to get done. But sometimes changing 3.7 to 3.70 back and forth to see what looks better is just too addicting and sucks my attention away from other things. On the plus side, breaking tasks into smaller pieces as in previous weeks, like gathering transcripts one day and setting up my account another, has helped me avoid feeling overwhelmed. It’s also reassuring to remember that my materials (whether for grad school or jobs) can always be tweaked or updated if I learn something new or get feedback. Moving forward, I need to work on just “sending it,” because I can’t perfect anything if I never let it see the light of day.

### Week 6

**What did you do last week?**

This past week was entirely centered on finishing my Georgia Tech Master's application, as my goal for the week was to make sure it was submitted by the end of the week so that I could start shifting my focus towards job applications. I had several people review my resume to make some final adjustments before deciding that it's good enough. After this, I had to go through the application and answer all the short answer questions, which took a lot longer than I was expecting. They're all short questions, but I quickly realized that having to be succinct was quite a challenge, because there's an inherent desire to explain everything and make yourself look good. Instead I realized that the application seems to genuinely just want clarity and minimal decorations. They want to know how you are prepared for this specific program with regard to CS skills. They aren't really interested in anything else. The one question that took me a lot of time was stating my post-bachelor work CS-related experience. My job was very heavily wet lab biochemical, molecular, and cellular biology focused, with the extent of my data analysis being in excel or spotfire. I wanted to somehow embellish this experience and somehow tie in CS-related work, but in the end I decided to just be honest in saying that I did not have any CS-related work experience. Regardless, I finished all the questions and I'm happy to say that I finally hit submit after going through the entire application with my brother, just to make sure I didn't make any silly mistakes.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week I am planning to shift my focus from my academic future to my career future. Now that I'm done with my application, I need to focus on preparing for internships and jobs, with the hope in mind that I will be accepted. Acceptance into the Master's will open me up to a lot more jobs and I need to prepare my materials with the expectation that I will be accepted. I was debating whether or not I should apply to jobs before or after hearing back, and I think I want to wait, because I don't want to have to figure out how to update companies with the information that I was accepted. I would rather have all that information combined in my resume, especially for positions I am very excited about. So, at a minimum, I would like to have my resume set up for job applications (some slight modifications from the one I used for the grad application) and a template cover letter. I am going to prepare both with the expectation that I will be accepted, which means writing this information in the resume and in the cover letter.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

The biggest new impediment this week is the graduate application. The sooner I hear back the better for the next step of applying for jobs and internships. Besides that, all the impediments from future weeks are still present in regards to time management, stress, anxiety, etc. Luckily, I'm still on a good track and have been improving my ability to manage all these impediments as the weeks go by. This is my last semester of the program, and the closer I get to being done, the more and more I feel like I am getting back into the career/professional life. I haven't enjoyed being exclusively a student, so the ability to feel like an adult again soon is exciting and I have a lot of motivation to take these next career steps.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

This week, I just need to take the same process I have been using, and simply shift the focus. I have had a good process and system going, so shifting the focus rather than trying to reinvent the wheel will be very beneficial for me as I continue on in this project. 

---

### Week 7

**What did you do last week?**

This past week, I made good on my plan/intention to start shifting away from my graduate school focus towards a career focus. This worked out well because this shift in focus perfectly coincided with our professional development course's week dedicated to reviewing the school's career services and LinkedIn Learning offerings, both of which can be beneficial for my transition. This exploration took longer than anticipated and took away some of my scheduled time for working on job application materials, so most of this week's effort was spent working on exploring these services, tools, videos, and writing the required review of the materials. That said, the time spent was still valuable for my professional development effort/transition, and even with the added work, I was able to make modifications to my resume. It now looks more like a resume for tech job applications, where the focus is more on my skills rather than past unrelated experiences which I had higher up for my grad applications since experiences are usually valued more highly there.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week I plan to continue preparing my job application materials by creating a template cover letter that I can easily tailor for individual job applications. I will also start spending a significant amount of my free time looking at jobs in the current market to see if there is anything I can do or prepare outside of school coursework. One area where I fall short is my list of projects, but I’m not sure I have enough time to complete an impressive side project before I begin sending out job applications. I think my previous plan of working on smaller, more productivity-related skills is better, so getting a good sense of what sorts of side skills are valuable in the current market seems like a good idea. My thoughts are still that learning Vim would be really beneficial for my long-term career, but I'm starting to question if that's really the case with where AI-based coding seems to be going. If coding becomes highly GUI based, primarily based on accepting or rejecting changes, keyboard schortcuts might not be all that helpful.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

The biggest impediments in the past were my time management and stress, but now that my Georgia Tech application is submitted, I feel an immense pressure lifted off my shoulders, and I feel much more eager to move forward. The new impediment will now just be learning to handle rejection well and dealing with the stress of waiting to hear back regarding positions I apply for. 

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

This past week, I didn't spend as much time as I would have liked to on my project due to the need to explore the career services and LinkedIn Learning offerings. This isn't necessarily a problem, but in regards to my project, I will have more time and ability to focus on my career development now that I have completed that required activity.

---

### Week 8

**What did you do last week?**

Last week, I successfully accomplished the major goals I set for transitioning my focus from academic applications to launching my career. I dedicated significant time to revising my resume, ensuring that it now highlights/emphasizes my technical skills, recent projects, and tailored experience for tech job applications. In parallel, I creqted a versatile cover letter template that not only communicates my background and enthusiasm for the roles I’m targeting but can also be easily customized for different job postings. I also revisited my LinkedIn profile and incorporated peer feedback to improve its clarity, readability, and impact (rewriting certain descriptions that didn't sound as impressive as they could). The process of iterating on these materials was both challenging and rewarding, as it pushed me to refine my story and present my accomplishments with greater confidence. Having gone through all of this, I am much more confident in myself as a productive member of society, and I'm finally gaining an appreciation for what I've accomplished. That said, I recognize that I am an entry level candidate, so I'm crossing my fingers that an expected masters will sweeten the deal enough for potential employers (this information is in my cover letter).

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week, I plan to shift my attention towards actively entering into the job market using my updated materials. My primary focus for now will be on applying to a curated list of tech positions that align with my career objectives, but which are not my top choices. I intend to send out a series of test applications to gauge the responsiveness of potential employers and gather further feedback on my application documents. I am very hopeful that I can land some interviews because these will be invaluable practice for late on, when I'm at my most nervous, applying for my dream roles. Even if I surely wouldn't accept some of the roles, I will still say yes to each step for practice, and because there is always a chance I make a good connection or get new information that changes everything. 

I also recognize that I need to pick up the pace now that the major goal of my application is behind me. With the project update due soon, I plan to use that opportunity to reevaluate my strategy and determine my next steps. I will begin drafting that update this week to ensure I stay on track and make the necessary adjustments moving forward.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

While finalizing my resume and cover letter has alleviated some of the initial stress, I still face challenges related to the uncertainty of the job application process. The anxiety of waiting for responses and managing potential rejections remains a concern and source of negativity. Moreover, balancing these efforts with ongoing coursework and personal commitments can be demanding. The stress alone sometimes stops me from getter anything else done, or will cause me to waste hours browsing job boards, only serving to add worry as I find more jobs to apply for, but with not a single application sent out yet. Nonetheless, by maintaining a structured schedule and regularly seeking feedback, I am confident that I can navigate these challenges effectively.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

Reflecting on my progress last week, breaking down the revision process into focused, manageable tasks proved invaluable. Gathering and requesting timely feedback and iterating on each component helped me overcome perfectionism and produce stronger, more impactful materials. Moving forward, I plan to set concrete mini-deadlines for each stage of my job application process. This structured approach not only minimizes procrastination but also builds momentum and confidence as I transition fully into my career pursuits.
