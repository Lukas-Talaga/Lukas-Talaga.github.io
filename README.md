## Project Proposal: Structured Career Development for a Competitive Tech Job Market

**Vision Statement:**  
The goal of this project is to help me improve my professional skills by working on job application materials, applying to grad school, building up technical skills, and preparing for interviews. Breaking my transition into the workforce or graduate school into smaller, manageable steps allows me to stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This course provides a great opportunity for professional growth because of its structured feedback and accountability, helping me stay on track. The project gives me a solid plan for moving from being a full-time student into a professional career by focusing on key milestones like improving my resume, practicing for interviews, and enhancing my technical abilities. Sticking to this plan will help me improve my job prospects and develop the skills I need to succeed in the workforce. The structured grading and public feedback also push me to stay engaged and keep making progress.

**Motivation:**  
This professional development course keeps me accountable and provides structure to my job search. I paused working to focus on a post-baccalaureate degree, so I need a clear plan for returning to the workforce. The current job market is extremely competitive, and I want to ensure I stand out as a strong candidate. More importantly, I want to land a job that I enjoy, and the only way to do that is by putting in effort to become the best candidate I can be. By setting milestones and tracking my progress, I can overcome my usual "paralysis by analysis" and take meaningful steps toward securing a job or internship. My goals of applying to graduate school both serve to satisfy my continued interest and curiosity in computer science while also making me eligible for graduate-level internships. The notoriety of Georgia Tech can also be highly advantageous as I apply for jobs or if recruiters land on my social pages. The work I put into this project will not only help me now but will also continue to benefit my career in the long run.

**Specific and Measurable Goals:**

- **Letters of Recommendation:** Request and obtain letters from professors for graduate school applications.
- **Resume Creation and Refinement:** Develop a polished resume with feedback from others.
- **LinkedIn Optimization:** Update and refine my LinkedIn profile to align with target job roles.
- **Cover Letter Development:** Draft a strong cover letter template that can be customized for different job applications.
- **Graduate School Application:** Complete and submit an application to Georgia Tech’s Online CS Master’s program.
- **GitHub and Portfolio Enhancement:** Improve my GitHub profile, make select projects public, and build a professional personal website.
- **Job and Internship Applications:** Apply strategically to preferred positions while also submitting bulk/mass applications to increase opportunities.
- **Interview Preparation:** Research and practice common technical (LeetCode) and behavioral interview questions.
- **Technical Skill Development:** Build proficiency in Git and Vim to improve workflow efficiency and demonstrate technical competency to employers.

**Challenges and Risks:**

- **Psychological Barriers:** Imposter syndrome, anxiety, and stress could slow progress.
- **Time Constraints:** Balancing coursework, job applications, and potential interviews may be challenging.
- **Technical Learning Curve:** Mastering Vim and Git takes time, and reaching a useful level of proficiency may require significant effort.
- **External Factors:** Recommendation letters, job application responses, and interview scheduling are outside of my control and require flexibility.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Regular Office Hour Participation:** Engaging with peers and instructors to stay motivated and recieve guidance when needed.
- **Breaking Down Tasks:** Splitting bigger goals into smaller steps to make progress feel more manageable.
- **Dedicated Work Sessions:** Setting aside specific times to work on job applications, technical prep, and other project tasks.
- **Managing Stress:** Taking breaks, exercising, and reaching out for support when needed.
- **Practical Technical Learning:** Focusing on the most useful features of Vim and Git rather than trying to master everything at once.
- **Staying Flexible:** Adjusting plans based on external factors like job market changes or unexpected opportunities.

**Project Assessment Criteria:**

- **Resume:** Completed and refined based on feedback.
- **LinkedIn:** Updated and optimized for job searches.
- **Cover Letter:** Drafted and adapted for multiple job applications.
- **Job Applications:** At least 5 targeted applications submitted.
- **Graduate School Application:** All required components submitted on time, including recommendation letters.
- **Interview Preparation:** Practicing technical and behavioral questions to improve confidence.
- **GitHub and Portfolio:** Well-documented projects, an improved home profile page, and a professional website showcasing my resume, projects, and blog.
- **Technical Proficiency:** Demonstrated knowledge of Git and Vim.

## Weekly Status Updates

---

### Week 2

**What did you do last week?**

Last week, I oriented myself in all my courses, posted all my Piazza introductions, and started on Week 1 materials. Besides this Professional Development course, I am also taking Database Systems and Software Development Tools. The only office hours I attended were for this course, as I hadn’t gone through the week’s material yet for the other courses. Office hours were great for brainstorming ideas with other students and beginning to discuss and develop my project. I then spent the rest of the week passively thinking about my project idea while reading through the materials for making a website. My goal even before the course started was to use this course to force myself to start preparing myself for the transition from student to employee. I had stopped working to take this program full-time, so I want to use this course to increase my likelihood of finding a job or internship that I am proud to have. The idea of setting milestones and timelines will be extremely helpful in organizing this transition and force me to stop putting it off. Currently, I am in a “paralysis by analysis” state.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week I want to solidify my goals for the project. I want to create an ordered list of tasks based on importance and “due date”. I also want to split up each task into smaller pieces to avoid getting overwhelmed and focus on one thing at a time rather than being anxious about how difficult or stressful the whole task is. My current goals for my professional development during this semester are to ask for letters of recommendation, refine my resume, update my LinkedIn, update my GitHub, apply for Georgia Tech’s Online CS Masters (this opens up internship opportunities), tailor my resume and cover letters to the jobs and internships I am most excited about, blast my resume out to as many other positions as possible to practice interviews and have backups, use the rest of my time to learn a tool that would make me more valuable or attractive (like learning Vim because it’s a way to show off or impress people and isn’t easy to learn since it needs to be memorized to be useful).

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

The biggest impediments to my progress are completely mental and have to do with getting anxious, stressed, nervous, or depressed based on what happens during this semester. Asking for letters of recommendation is very stressful because of imposter syndrome, nervousness can make a person look rigid while interviewing, the anxiety of waiting to hear back from the masters or jobs can make it difficult to concentrate, and rejection can be quite depressing. All of these put together can be very overwhelming and can make it very hard to stay motivated and focused. The job market is tough right now for new hires, so staying mentally healthy and sane is going to be as much of a challenge as any technical “real” problem.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

I’ve found that going to office hours and being able to talk through ideas somehow makes the whole project feel more manageable. When it’s stuck in my head, it feels like a lot, but then when I talk it through, I realize that I can accomplish what I want to during this semester. Office hours also makes me process work better because I can ask for people’s opinions and advice, which is what I did this week when I asked for advice about putting projects on my resume. Talking about this with people who have been through the process or have been on the other side de-mystifies it and helps me make a final decision. Finally, last week I just had project ideas in my head, but something that would help is finally sitting down and writing them all out. It will allow me to move past brainstorming and figure out how to organize them.

### Week 3

**What did you do last week?**

Last week, I solidified my goals for what I want to accomplish this semester as part of this professional development course and got started with my first, most important goals. It took me a little over an hour just to put together the project proposal and submit it on Piazza, my website, and Moodle, and that’s not to mention the time spent thinking it through and planning/outlining. Other than that, I spent an hour drafting up an email for professors I wanted to ask for letters of recommendation. I then showed this to some peers and was instantly told that it was far too long and polite, which was quite frustrating, but I understand now. This meant I had to go back and prune out all the unimportant information before sending it out to 3 past professors. The personalization was mostly just in the introduction and stating which courses I took with them as a reminder, so that wasn’t too difficult.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week, now that this request for the letters of recommendation is out of the way, I need to go in and add these professors (provided that they accept) to my online application so that they receive instructions on how to submit. Then I plan to start filling out the information and looking at the short answer questions so that I can start thinking about how I will want to answer them. Finally, I want to finish updating my resume so that I can start sending it out for job applications. I think I will first try to send it out to some “feeler” companies just to get a sense of how I stand in relation to other candidates, ask for feedback, and possibly even get offered interviews that I can use as practice.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

One of the biggest impediments from the previous week was being overwhelmed, but now that I have everything on paper and laid out, I’m finding that I’m feeling a lot less stressed and anxious. Asking for letters of recommendation is always really difficult for me because it’s hard to ask someone to do something for you that they are not required to do, and which gives them extra work. Other than that, my biggest impediments are some of my recommendation requests getting denied or not getting replies, and a lot of constructive criticism on my resume which required me to increase the time spent modifying and revising. Fortunately, it’s worth the extra effort, but at some point, I will need to draw a line and be proud of what I have.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

The process I used last week was just treating all of my project goals as… part of a project. The reason this helps me so much is because I feel a sense of urgency and the requirement to complete these milestones within a specific timeframe. It doesn’t let me procrastinate as much which helps my overall process just flow smoother. The process will continue to work better if I get better at my time management. I still suffer from major procrastination and do things at the last moment, so getting better at sitting down and focusing would go a long way. This career searching process can take months, so this is a skill I need to develop so that I do not get lazy and demotivated. The quicker I find a job, the quicker I’ll be happy to no longer just be a student.

### Week 4

**What did you do last week?**

Last week’s focus was on moving forward with my main and most time sensitive professional development goals. First, I finally finished updating my resume with up to date information, which took more time than I initially anticipated because I kept revisiting and polishing the details. I also got two responses regarding my letters of recommendation. Both professors I reached out to were very supportive and agreed to write letters on my behalf, which took a huge weight off my shoulders. Each of them asked for some extra details about myself, so I also spent time replying. Beyond that, I officially started the Georgia Tech application, filling out the basic information and setting up my account so that I can get to the short answers and other application components quickly. I told my recommenders that I would submit them as recommenders by the end of the week.

**What do you plan to do this week?**

This week, my main objectives are to have people proofread my resume and provide constructive feedback, completely finish my Georgia Tech application, and secure all three recommenders. Regarding the resume, while it is fully updated now, it’s also far too long and I need help choosing what information to keep and what to leave out. Sometimes I feel like that’s the hardest part because there’s so much pressure on making a good first impression, and everyone’s opinion is so different. Regardless, I’m making this week a deadline so that I force myself to get it done and become comfortable with my choices (recognizing that it can change based on what position I’m applying for). I then need to finalize any short answer questions or essays required by the application, which might take some time to polish and align with the program’s expectations. Lastly, if my third recommender doesn’t respond within the next couple days and after two follow up emails, I will have to quickly secure a third, which would be my former manager.

**Are there any impediments in your way?**

Right now, the biggest impediment is making sure my third recommender responds or that I find a new one and I give them enough time to write a strong letter. It’s always a little stressful because, even though professors are often willing, I can’t know if someone just happens to be on vacation or sick. Another potential impediment is running into unexpected requirements or questions for the Georgia Tech application that might take more time than I’ve planned. As always, time management is still a challenge. I recognize that this course should only take up 3-5 hours a week, but due to the fact that this is also something I HAVE to be doing for my career, I easily go over that. This is especially true when it comes to the resume. Simple formatting changes can take over an hour sometimes, and feedback regarding format can sometimes cause everything else to have to change.

**Reflect on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**

The process of dividing everything into manageable tasks is continuing to pay off. Finishing updating my resume with current information and starting the application felt a lot less daunting once I broke them down into smaller “sub-tasks” rather than taking on “updating resume” and “finishing application” all at once. For the resume, I started by throwing everything in a document, then rewording, then polishing, then formatting, and only now am I worrying about the length. This helped me avoid procrastination and allowed me to focus on one step at a time rather than trying to polish before all the info was even there. Moving forward, I want to keep improving my time management by setting more concrete deadlines for each of my application components. This way, I can hold myself accountable and make sure I’m not leaving any parts of the application or recommendation requests until the last minute.
